This project uses different datsets collected by Epidemic Intelligence team based on different authorized reports [1]. Therefore ECDC's data keep worlwide data on daily and weekly basis, the most complete statistics provided for the European Union (EU) with 7-days frequency. That happens because every week a team of epidemiologists screen up to 500 relevant sources to collect the latest figures for publication [2]. \n",

Each of the links provided here keeps data link and data glossary also. \n",
