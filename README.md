In the exploration, i tryed to answer these questions
#### What is the best way to compare testings?
#### Is there correlation between testing rate and positivity rate?
#### What is an association between new cases and deaths?
#### Which country descibes the highest number of deaths?
#### Which is the deaths variability across countries?


This project describes end-to-end data analysis of COVID-19 related data, including data uploading, filtering, reshaping, transformation and visualization. The main aspects of the project are relevant to the weekly data of 2020 statistics by 15 countries: Greece Malta,Italy,Portugal,Latvia,Denmark,Czechia ,Sweden ,Belgium,France, Netherlands, Slovenia, Estonia,Germany,Ireland
Along the study there were found that Denmark describes the highest testing rate along 2020 year.
